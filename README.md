# MRI Diagnosis using CNN and Transfer Learning

This repository contains the code for a graduate project focused on MRI Diagnosis. The project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Transfer Learning techniques to analyze MRI scans.

## Project Overview

The project was completed as part of a master's course and is implemented using Jupyter Notebook. The database for the project was created using MRI scans.

## Technologies Used

- **Google Colab:** The project was developed and run entirely in Google Colab, a cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment that allows for free GPU use.

- **TensorFlow:** TensorFlow, an open-source platform for machine learning, was used to build and train the CNN.

- **Scikit-Learn (sklearn):** Scikit-Learn, a machine learning library for Python, was used for various tasks such as model evaluation and data preprocessing.

- **Xception:** The Xception model, a deep convolutional neural network architecture, was used as a pre-trained model for transfer learning.

## Getting Started

To run the project, you will need to have Jupyter Notebook installed. You can then clone this repository and open the `.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
